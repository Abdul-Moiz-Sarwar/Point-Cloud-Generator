# 3D Point Cloud Generator

Convert 2D images into 3D point clouds by replacing pixels with colored 3D planes. Export the generated point cloud in various 3D formats, such as .obj, for further editing in any 3D motion graphics software. The project also provides an interactive window to view the point cloud and move around it using the mouse and keyboard in real-time.

## Introduction

This project utilizes the Processing IDE with a C++ script to transform 2D images into 3D point clouds. Each pixel in the image is replaced by a 3D plane in a 3D space, preserving the color information. The resulting point cloud can be exported in different 3D formats, such as .obj, allowing users to further edit and integrate the generated 3D model into various 3D motion graphics software. The project also includes an interactive window for real-time exploration of the point cloud.

## Features

- Convert 2D images into 3D point clouds.
- Replace pixels with colored 3D planes.
- Export point clouds in various 3D formats, including .obj.
- Real-time interactive window for viewing and navigating the point cloud.

## Prerequisites

Before using the converter, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- Processing IDE installed.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Open the project in the Processing IDE.

3. Run the script to convert images into 3D point clouds.

## Usage
